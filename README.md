## Clone
If you have git installed in your computer, then you can clone it using git easily:

```git clone https://github.com/zonayedpca/civilAviationWeatherApp.git```

Otherwise, you may want to download it directly from [here](https://github.com/zonayedpca/civilAviationWeatherApp/archive/master.zip). After downloading, yoy may require some additional tasks as extract and so on. But in both case make sure you are using CLI inside the project directory where the **package.json** file is located.

## Package Install
Open you CLI tool and type this command below. You must require to install node and npm to your machine

```npm install```

## Start Development
To start the development. Write this command to your CLI:

```npm start```

## Build for Production
Once you're done with the development, you can make the production build for the application by this command:

```npm run build```

Make sure the **homepage** inside **package.json** file is exactly set as where you do want to put your production build. In my case, it's my demo URL
